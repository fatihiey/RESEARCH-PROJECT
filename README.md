# Estimation for Energy Consumption for Domestic and Public Buildings in London using Machine Learning

This research project explores new approaches for estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from domestic and public buildings in London using machine learning and 
geospatial analysis.

## 🔍 Objective
To develop a predictive model for estimating CO₂ emissions and energy consumption using real-world datasets and deep learning techniques
and machine learning (XGBoost,GBoosting,SVM and Neural Networks).

## 📊 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and wrangling from multiple sources
- Feature selection and model development using Scikit-learn
- Geospatial data manipulation with GeoPandas and Xarray
- Visualizations and comparison across different boroughs in London

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Deep Learning** (Keras, TensorFlow)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for documentation and exploratory analysis
